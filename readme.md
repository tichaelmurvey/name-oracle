# Fantasy / Sci-fi name generator

I built a full stack web application to help nerds come up with names for their RPG characters. It’s called The Name Oracle.

Here’s a link to the [live site](https://www.nameoracle.org/).

What is this thing
Some people (me) spend their time playing imagination storytelling games involving dice. Imagination mostly comes naturally, but coming up with names can be really hard in the moment!

On this site, users can input a setting and role, and get a brand new name. They can also get a list of names if they want.

The names are compounded from tagged items in a large database so it’s really, really unlikely you’ll get the same name twice.

How is it built
The stack is MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, and some simple EJS for the components and variable rendering. There’s some basic JS on the front end.

I learned a lot making this, including that I shouldn’t upload my ENV file to Github. Real expert level stuff.
